Never use an insecure password again.

What is a Password Generator?
Just as its name sounds, password generators are online tools that create customized passwords for users. 
These originators create strong and random passwords for each subscriber account. 
The most advantaged are individuals who frequently need to create and manage new passwords. 
Other than creating passwords, the originators securely manage a large number of passwords. 
Yes, generators aid in creating new strong passwords, but are they all the same?

Varying password generators form passwords differently. 
They are like software programmed to work differently. 
Some create passwords randomly by combining numbers, special characters, and letters to form complex passwords. 
However, some are programmed to produce pronounceable passwords.
